# Primal-Dual Interior Point Newton Method
#
# This is specifically for QPs and Interior Point
#
#
# minimize_x f(x)
# subject to Ax ≦ b
#
# We rewrite this as f(x) - λT g(x)
# Where g(x) are the constraints such that c(x) ≧ 0 and λ ≧ 0
# The first-order condition of the KKT is
# ∇f(x) - λT ∇g(x) = 0
#
# Now we want to use a Primal-Dual trick for a Log-Barrier
# (i.e. Interior Point). We have
#
# minimize_x f(x) - μ log(g(x))
# The first-order condition of the KKT is
# ∇f(x) - μ ∇g(x) / g(x) = 0
#
# So, λT = μ / g(x)
#
# -------------------------
#
# Now, we want to use Newton's Method.
#
# We make a vector h = [x λ]T and r = r(x, λ) and we update h as
# h ← h + ∇r^{-1} r
# Where
# r = (∇f(x) + λT ∇g(x))
#     ( -diag(λ) g(x) - μ 1)
#
# So ∇r = [A B; C D]
# Where:
# A = ∇^2 f(x) + λT ∇^2 g(x)
# B = ∇g(x)^T
# C = - diag(λ) ∇g(x)
# D = -diag(g(x))
#
# --------------------------
#
# We can simplify with the QP assumption
#
# minimize_x (1/2) xT Q x + cT x
# subject to Ax ⩽ B
#
# where (all are Real)
# Q is an nxn Symmetric Matrix (that is positive definite for convex)
# x is an nx1 vector
# c is an nx1 vector
# A is an mxn Matrix
# b is an mx1 vector
#
#
# So,
# ∇f(x) = Qx + c
# ∇^2f(x) = Q
#
# ∇g(x) = ∇(Ax - b) = A
# ∇^2g(x) = 0
#
# Thus,
# # r = (  ∇f(x) + λT ∇g(x) )  = (        Qx + c + λT A        )
#       (-diag(λ) g(x) - μ 1)  = (-diag(λ) Ax - diag(λ) b - μ 1)
#
# So ∇r = [A B; C D]
# Where:
# A = ∇^2 f(x) + λT ∇^2 g(x) = Q
# B = ∇g(x)^T                = A^T
# C = - diag(λ) ∇g(x)        = -diag(λ) A
# D = -diag(g(x))            = -diag(Ax - b)
#
# ----------------------------
# Therefore we need two parts, the outer part that updates μ and
# the inner part that runs the Newton Update
#
# This script is the outer part.
