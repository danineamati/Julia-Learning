# User Interface to Module

This section details how to interface with the module to begin optimizing
trajectories.

To interface with the solver, please construct the following objects:
1. A rocket and guess trajectory
2. An objective
3. The constraints
4. The augmented lagrangian

Thereafter, you can solve the problem. This user interface section will guide
you in creating each of these objects.
