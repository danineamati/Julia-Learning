    makeGroundConstraint(NSteps::Int64, nDim::Int64, index = 2)

Creates an [`AL_AffineInequality`](@ref) constraint such that the rocket stays
above the ground. (Constraint has form Ax - b â‰¤ 0). Ignores the last point
in the trajectory.

Usage: `NSteps` states the number of timesteps in the trajectory. `nDim` states
the dimensionality of the problem (e.g. 1D, 2D, or 3D). Index describes which
direction is up (e.g. index = 2 means "y" is up).
